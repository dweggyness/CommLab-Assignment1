# CommLab-Assignment1
Project Name: 30 Minute Film Festival - Online Business with Portals
https://dweggyness.github.io/CommLab-Assignment1/index.html

Project Description: The project is about making a site for a video we made in class. The main idea of the video was centered around this online transaction that was going on through Zoom,
but we had the ability to pass items to each other through the screen. So a theme that I thought of was "portals" 

Process: I added color hints of blue/orange to certain elements to build on the theme of Portals which was seen in the movie poster at the top of the page, which had blue/orange portals.

Reflection/Evaluation: Yep, my expectations were met. Would've been better if I was able to find a nice background for the site but I couldn't find anything.
